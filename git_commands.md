This discards all changes in your working directory and staging area, making your repository match the latest commit.

git reset --hard <commit> <commit>: This can be a specific commit hash, a branch name, HEAD~1 (the previous commit), or simply HEAD to reset to the latest commit.

If you don't specify a commit, git reset --hard will reset to HEAD, meaning it will discard all uncommitted changes in the working directory and staging area and keep the branch at the latest commit.
